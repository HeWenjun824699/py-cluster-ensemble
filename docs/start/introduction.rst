Introduction

[cite_start]**py-cluster-ensemble (PCE)** is a comprehensive Python toolkit designed for cluster ensemble generation, consensus algorithms, and automated experimentation[cite: 1, 14]. [cite_start]It specifically serves researchers and the academic community by providing a unified framework for complex ensemble clustering tasks[cite: 1, 14].

[cite_start]PCE covers the complete technical workflow, from constructing base clustering pools to deriving final ensemble consensus partitions[cite: 1, 2].

Key Highlights
--------------

* [cite_start]**Extensive Algorithm Support**: Implements a wide range of consensus algorithms spanning over two decades of research (2003–2025)[cite: 5, 6].
* [cite_start]**Academic Reproducibility**: Features automated experimentation pipelines and intelligent hyperparameter searching to ensure results are consistent and reproducible[cite: 2, 11].
* [cite_start]**Seamless MATLAB Integration**: Provides a robust data interface for interacting with MATLAB ``.mat`` files (including v7.3 compatibility) and automatic index correction (1-based to 0-based)[cite: 3, 4].
* [cite_start]**Paper-Quality Analysis**: Includes built-in visualization tools for t-SNE/PCA reduction, co-association heatmaps, and metric sensitivity analysis[cite: 9].
* [cite_start]**Comprehensive Metrics**: Offers a suite of 14 clustering validation metrics, such as ACC, NMI, and ARI, for both single-run and batch evaluation[cite: 7, 8].
